# latam_airlines_scraper_selenium
This repo contains a Python script that opens the website of LATAM airlines, inputs some parameters in the flight search fields and scrapes some data off of the page using Python selenium

# 1. The Objective of the Project
This small project demonstrates how to use Python Selenium to control a webpage. I chose the LATAM airlines [website](https://www.latamairlines.com/us/en) to show how to use th basic functions of Selenium such as:
- Maximizing the window
- Extracting data points from the pages' HTML code
- Locating and clicking on elements
- Inserting data into fields
- Choosing dates from a drop-down menu

The steps performed by the code are as follows:
- Navigate to the **US website**
- Enter the **flight origin**
- Enter the **flight destination**
- Check the **Use LATAM Pass Miles** checkbox
- Choose a **departure date**
- Choose a **return date**
- Click **Enter**

These fields are shown in the image below...
